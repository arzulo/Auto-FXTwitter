# Auto-FXTwitter

A Firefox extension for automatically converting all twitter.com & x.com links copied from a tweet's share button to fxtwitter.com.
Paritcularly useful for easier embeds in Discord, as Discord doesn't embed twitter.com and x.com links normally.

Download the current version of the extension from Firefox addons [here](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/auto-fxtwitter/)

> [!NOTE]
**Please note!**
This extension **ONLY** works by using the _"Share" -> "Copy link"_ buttons attached to tweets.
For security reasons developers aren't allowed to access copied clipboard information through your address bar.
That is to say, this extension will not work by right clicking and copying your address bar.
